- 👋 Hi, I’m @pfj14807
- 👀 I’m interested in using a Raspberry Pi 4 to monitor home energy use. My motivation is that I use an 36kW Vailant Thermal Storage system that is no longer supported by the maufacturer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning both Python and the Vailant system. My expectation is that leatrning both will be easier by monitoring energy use and thermal conditions as I tweek system operational parameters. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on existing software, specifically David00's Home Energy Monitoring Project. I am unsure as to how I can contribute; first I need to learn about the colaboration process.
